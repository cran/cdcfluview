#' Mortality Surveillance Data from the National Center for Health Statistics (deprecated)
#'
#' The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) collects and disseminates the Nation's
#' official vital statistics. These statistics are based on data provided to NCHS through
#' contracts with the vital registration systems operated in the various jurisdictions
#' legally responsible for the registration of deaths (i.e., death certificates) and other
#' vital events. These data have previously only been released as annual final data files
#' 12 months or more after the end of the data year. Recent NCHS efforts to improve the
#' timeliness of jurisdiction reporting and modernize the national vital statistics
#' infrastructure have created a system capable of supporting near real-time surveillance.
#' Capitalizing on these new capabilities, NCHS and CDCâ€™s Influenza Division have
#' partnered to pilot the use of NCHS mortality surveillance data for Pneumonia and
#' Influenza (P&I) mortality surveillance.
#'
#' NCHS mortality surveillance data are presented by the week the death occurred.
#' Nationally P&I percentages are released two weeks after the week of death to allow for
#' collection of enough data to produce a stable P&I percentage at the national level.
#' Collection of complete data is not expected, and reliable P&I ratios are not expected
#' at the region and state level within this two week period. State and Region level
#' counts will be released only after 20% of the expected number of deaths are reported
#' through the system.
